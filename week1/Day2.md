## 🔐 chmod Practice

### What I Did:
- Created a file: `touch secretscript.sh`
- Wrote a command inside it with `echo`
- Made it **private & executable only by me** with `chmod 700`

### What I Learned:
- `chmod 700` means: **rwx------** → only the owner has full access
- `./file.sh` runs the script
