# 🔐 Cloud Security – 90 Days of Labs, Projects & Practical Learning

Welcome to my 90-day Cloud Security Journey. I’m learning by **reading, building, breaking, fixing, and sharing** — while creating beginner-friendly resources anyone can follow.

---

## 📅 Journey Plan

> I follow a **realistic rhythm**:  
> 🧠 2 days to study → 🔨 3 days to practice → 📝 1 day to write/share  
> 🙌🏽 Sundays are rest/catch-up days.

## 🧠 Study → Build Flow

Every week is broken like this:

| Day | Task |
|-----|------|
| Mon | 📘 Read Docs + Watch videos |
| Tue | 🧠 Learn Concepts |
| Wed | 🔧 Practice (mini project) |
| Thu | 🔧 Continue project |
| Fri | 🛠 Fix, improve, break intentionally |
| Sat | 📸 Document + Record (GitHub, YouTube, Instagram) |
| Sun | 🧘🏽‍♀️ Rest or Catch-Up |
