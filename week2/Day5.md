# Day 5 – Document & Reflect

## 📘 What I Learned

- Nmap shows running services and open ports.
- UFW is easy to configure and very powerful.
- Fail2Ban is essential for SSH protection.

## 🧠 Reflections

- I didn’t realize how many services were open by default.
- The attack surface was larger than expected before using UFW.
- UFW + Fail2Ban setup took <30 minutes and gave instant protection.

## 🔗 Next Step

- Harden SSH configurations
- Disable unnecessary services from Nmap scan
- Push everything to GitHub and share publicly
